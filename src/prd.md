# AI Conversation Assistant PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Create a real-time AI conversation assistant that transcribes, summarizes, and answers questions from audio input.
- **Success Indicators**: Accurate transcription, relevant summaries, and helpful answers to detected or manually entered questions.
- **Experience Qualities**: Intuitive, Responsive, Intelligent

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming (transcripts and AI-generated content) and Interacting (asking questions)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Users need a way to capture, understand, and interact with spoken conversations in real-time.
- **User Context**: During meetings, lectures, or conversations where users want to focus on the interaction while capturing content for later reference.
- **Critical Path**: Start recording → View real-time transcript → Get summaries → Ask/receive answers to questions
- **Key Moments**: 
  1. Starting/stopping recording with a single action
  2. Seeing transcribed text appear in real-time
  3. Receiving instant answers to questions detected in the conversation

## Essential Features
1. **Audio Recording**
   - What: Toggle recording from microphone or system audio
   - Why: Captures the raw audio data for processing
   - Success: Audio is captured clearly without interruption

2. **Speech-to-Text Transcription**
   - What: Convert spoken words to text with speaker identification
   - Why: Creates a searchable, readable record of the conversation
   - Success: Accurate transcription with proper speaker attribution

3. **Summarization**
   - What: Generate concise summaries for chunks of conversation
   - Why: Provides quick understanding without reading full transcript
   - Success: Summaries capture key points and context

4. **Question Detection & Answering**
   - What: Identify questions in the conversation and provide AI-generated answers
   - Why: Offers immediate value and insights during the conversation
   - Success: Accurate question detection and relevant, helpful answers

5. **Settings Management**
   - What: Configure Azure services and application preferences
   - Why: Allows customization and connection to necessary backend services
   - Success: Settings are saved and services connect properly

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Confidence, clarity, and ease
- **Design Personality**: Modern, professional with touches of warmth
- **Visual Metaphors**: Sound waves, conversation bubbles, AI assistance
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that emphasizes content over controls

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#2563eb) - communicates trust, intelligence, and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: Light blue tints for UI elements and backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Purple (#7c3aed) for highlighting important actions and states
- **Color Psychology**: Blues create a sense of calm and focus, purple adds a touch of creativity and innovation
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards for contrast
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (#f8fafc) with Foreground (#1e293b)
  - Card (#ffffff) with Card-Foreground (#0f172a)
  - Primary (#2563eb) with Primary-Foreground (#ffffff)
  - Secondary (#f1f5f9) with Secondary-Foreground (#0f172a)
  - Accent (#7c3aed) with Accent-Foreground (#ffffff)
  - Muted (#f1f5f9) with Muted-Foreground (#64748b)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Sans-serif for both headings and body text for clarity and readability
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size differentiation between headings (1.5-2.5rem), subheadings (1.25rem), and body text (1rem)
- **Font Personality**: Clean, modern, and highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Optimal line length (66 characters), comfortable line spacing (1.5), and adequate text size (16px base)
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent use of weights (regular for body, medium for subheadings, semibold for headings)
- **Which fonts**: Inter for headings and body text
- **Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent legibility at all sizes with proper letter spacing

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Recording button is prominent, with content areas clearly defined
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing between sections for visual clarity
- **Grid System**: 12-column grid for desktop, simplified for mobile
- **Responsive Approach**: Stack panels vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- **Content Density**: Moderate - balancing information richness with clarity

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle animations for state changes (recording/stopped), loading indicators
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Microphone button has the most prominent animation
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Animations are functional rather than decorative

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: 
  - Cards for content sections
  - Tabs for switching between views
  - Dialog for settings
  - Buttons for actions
  - Form elements for configuration
- **Component Customization**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows for cards
- **Component States**: Clear hover/active states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Microphone, gear/settings, document, chat bubbles
- **Component Hierarchy**: Record button is primary, view toggles are secondary
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px-based spacing (0.5rem, 1rem, 1.5rem, 2rem)
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Full-width components, simplified layout

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with reusable elements
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, component styles
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing and sizing throughout the interface
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance with a touch of innovation

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and UI elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Browser microphone access limitations, service connectivity issues
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful error messages for service failures, microphone access denials
- **Technical Constraints**: Browser limitations for system audio capture

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for longer conversations, potential for additional AI analysis features
- **Testing Focus**: Speech recognition accuracy, AI response quality
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle poor audio quality? How to manage API rate limits?

## Reflection
- This approach uniquely combines real-time transcription with AI analysis, creating value beyond simple recording
- We've assumed users have access to Azure services and API keys
- What would make this exceptional is extremely accurate transcription and truly insightful, context-aware AI responses
